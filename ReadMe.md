# Godot Chunked Vornoi Generator

This is a small project which creates Vornoi diagrams based on chunks, and is therefore infinite and consistent. Feel free to pull bits and pieces from it, or the whole thing - but let me know if you found it useful!

## Files

The important files are Main.tscn, Main.gd, and View.gd.

Main.tscn consists of a Main node and a View node, with the respective scripts attached. The main node generates Voronoi diagrams, and the View node displays them as Polygons2d.
